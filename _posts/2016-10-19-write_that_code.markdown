In the past few years, I've been spending most of my available time writing or learning how write code.
Most of my learning came from actually writing the code. Reading books and following tutorials showed me best-practices and techniques, but the actual writing of code is what really taught me what I know. It has helped me develop a sense of when the code I'm writing is clean and when it is messy.

It's only when I actually worked on my own projects (where I would sometimes have to write and rewrite again) that I noticed how code can get entangled and trip over itself.

When faced with my own spaghetti code, the seeds planted by 'best-practices' really started to grow. When I revisit old code and notice where it could have been improved, this does not make me sad. Instead this allows me to notice the subtle ways in which my 'coding eye' has become more sophisticated.

As we grow in our coding, not only does what we consider readable code become more defined and refined, but so does our ability to read code.

Code unlike other languages is easier to write than to read, but thankfully, developing one of these skills does develop the other.
