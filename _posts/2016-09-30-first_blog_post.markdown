It's 10:38PM, and I just realized this blog post is due in 3 days... aagh.
The suggested topic is "Why did I choose to become a Software Developer?"   I couldn't have suggested a better one myself. :)

##### I'll jump right in.

Writing code means problem solving and being creative, but these descriptions don't really capture the magic of coding. Coding is about creating something from nothing, about creating abstract structures in your mind that come to life. These are structures that you can then interact with, that others can interact with. They take on a life of their own! In short, when you code, you are god. Well... that's a bit of an exaggeration, you aren't really god.

Coding is also about learning a language. Many of us have had the pleasure of seeing a baby say its first words, the coding equivalent of suddenly using recursion without thinking, or spitting out a regular expression without wanting to kill yourself. Coding can be frustrating and it can have some steep learning curves, but when I help someone else with something that I've already mastered, I can really see how far I've come.

And finally, coding as I've learned it is a balance between design and functionality. The more I code and the more code I read, the more I can appreciate beautiful code. There are so many ways to do things, and it can be so tempting to try be clever and cut down on code. But when a coder hits a good balance of DRY-ness and friendliness, to me (and I'm sure that for you as well), this code is beautiful.
