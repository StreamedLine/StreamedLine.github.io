## For first time users

You start vim by typing `vim` into the terminal.

*insert mode* vs. *command mode*

**Insert mode** allows you to actually type into the window
**Command mode** allows you to do things like save the file, exit vim, and navigate.

press *i* to get in to insert mode. It will say --insert mode-- on the bottom of the screen.
press *esc* to go back into command mode.


### Command Mode

Here are some basic comands:

notice they start with` : `followed by a `command` and perhaps an `argument` 

`:save <desired file name>` to save the file.

`:x` to save and quit

`:q `to quit without saving

`:set bg=dark` sets the background dark and font light.

Some commands don't start with `:` and are designed to work with the text itself

`dd` will delete the line the cursor is on
`x` will delete the letter the cursor is on
`$` will go to the end of a line
`gg` will go to the beggining of a file

### Why Vim?

Vim is available on any mac/linux terminal!

Vim requires no mouse!

Vim is cool!

I personally have a lot to learn, but the above commands should get you started.
